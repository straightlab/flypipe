README

Usage:
bash charseq_flypipe.sh [/path/to/R01.fastq.gz] [/complete/desired/output/path/]
[# of cores to use] [dirty or cleanup]

Where the first argument is the single ended gzipped fastq file
Second is where you would like your output files
Third is the number of cores you'd like to use 
    [enter 1 if you don't want to parallelize]
Fourth is optional: type cleanup to automatically gzip intermediate files 
    after the run to save space"
    
ie:
bash charseq_flypipe.sh /data/cl8-test.fastq.gz /outputdirectory 4

output files are:
.ChARdnaRna.prioritized.sense.txt / .ChARdnaRna.prioritized.antisense.txt
    where RNA contacts were prioritized by annotation in the following order
	tRNA miscRNA ncRNA transcript three_prime_UTR five_prime_UTR exon intron miRNA gene gene_extended2000
	eg: a read matching both a ncRNA and a transcript would receive ncRNA annotations
	sense is for RNA specifically in the sense direction of the annotated transcript
	antisense are RNAs that did not initally align in sense but did antisense
	Header:
	DNA chrom	DNA pos	DNA posplus1	unique ID	DNA adjusted pos	DNA strand	DNA MAPQ	DNA CIGAR	RNA Fb..(gn/tr/...)

	as above but without 'rRNA' or 'FBgn0085813',
	ribosomal genes that occupy much of the dataset
.ChARdnaRna.notranscriptome
	contains RNA to DNA contacts that where the RNA was not assigned to a transcript from flybase

Description of code:
	Beginning with gzipped fastq's: PCR duplicates are removed using Super Deduper (Petersen, 2015)
	using the entire read length. Adapters are trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger, 2014) using a 
	composite set of Illumina adapters, leading/trailing cut length of 3, slidingwindow of 4:15, 
	and a minimum length of 36. RNA and DNA portions of the read are identified and split by a 
	custom python program that finds the bridge, uses its polarity to identify the reads, and 
	verifies that there is only a copy of the bridge. DNA is aligned to the dm3/release 5 using 
	bowtie2 (Langmead, 2012) with the --very-sensitive option except allowing one mismatch. RNA is 
	aligned to all transcriptomes from flybase (downloaded January 2016 versions r5.57) with the 
	same parameters, first forcing forward strandedness and then, for reads that didn't align 
	in the sense direction, permitting antisense alignment. Reads that had both aligning sense RNA 
	and DNA are linked, preserving the transcriptome annotations in the order tRNA, miscRNA, ncRNA,
	transcript, three_prime_UTR, five_prime_UTR, exon, intron, miRNA, gene, gene_extended2000 (eg: 
	a read matching both a ncRNA and a transcript would receive ncRNA annotations). If a read is
	not caught by a sense alignment but is caught by an antisense alignment, it is linked and ordered
	in the same manner. If an RNA read did not map to a transcriptome but did map to the genome, it
	is combined into a separate file with no annotation. Annotated (sense and antisense) reads then
	have rRNAs removed.

	        but can be modified to run on a mac by replacing "zcat" with "gunzip -c"
